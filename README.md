# Determining Real Exchange Rate as a Percentage of Deviation of Its Trend
This is a tutorial on how to Calculate Real Exchange Rate in Stata, as a percentage deviation from its trend

The Real Excahnge Rate is Determined from the norminal excange rate, by adjusting for relative consumer prices

This indicator is measured as a percentage deviation fro its trend

The illustration is made in ference to the following article: https://www.researchgate.net/publication/256667285_Assessing_Indicators_of_Currency_Crisis_in_Ethiopia_Signals_Approach 

The data used in this study was gathered from the IMFâ€™s International Financial Statistics (IFS)

## Stata Codes Used 
    import excel "C:\Users\sam\Desktop\REER.xlsx", sheet("Sheet1") firstrow
    gen Time=_n  
    regress REER Time
    predict Trend
    gen REER_Adj = ((REER-Trend)/Trend)*100
    twoway (line REER Time) (line Trend Time)
